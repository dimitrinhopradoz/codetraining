# LeetCode Roadmap
I'm using this [roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) that a friend sent to me.
The strategy used:
* Complete the easy from each node before moving on to the medium/hard ones;
* Study solutions from others and learn new concepts;
* Return to the challenges and try again randomly in a while.
